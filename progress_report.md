1. 
processing model: gpt-4o, 
target model: gpt-5-nano, 
evaluation model: gpt-5-nano
2. Gpt-5-nano will fail in llm-based procesing tasks. Gpt-3.5-turbo may fail in llm-based processing. Gpt-4o can always success.
3. All experiments, including rephrase, conditional probabilty, markov chain, rephrase + conditional probability all failed on target model gpt-5-nano. 
It directly responded with empty string. I suspect it has a strong filter after model response. Should I consider another model as target?
4. I will go through newest jailbreaking papers to find new methods.
An idea: try to hide the question in a story that has a context.
